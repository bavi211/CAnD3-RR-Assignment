# CAnD3-RR-Assignment

## Reproducible Research Data Activity

## Project Description

This project examines whether there is a statistically significant association between dwelling tenure status and self-rated mental health for older adults aged 65-80 living in urban areas using data from the 2017 Canadian General Social Survey. It also examines whether the association differs in magnitude and significance between males and females. The associations were not statistically significant, in both the model considering the whole sample and the sex-stratified models. Information about what files are included and instructions on how to use them to reproduce results are given below. 

## Data Source Availability Statement
The data used in this project come from the 2017 Canadian General Social Survey (Cycle 31). The dataset is available through ODESI, a service provided by the Ontario Council of University Libraries  (https://search1.odesi.ca/#/Links to an external site.). Access is restricted to those users who have a DLI License and can be used for statistical and research purposes. The terms of the license can be viewed here (https://www.statcan.gc.ca/eng/dli/licenceLinks to an external site.).

As part of McGill University, the CAnD3 initiative has a license to use the data for the purposes of training. Those outside of McGill university should not use the data provided through CAnD3's training activities for purposes not related to their CAnD3 training.

## Instructions for Data Preparation and Analysis
To reproduce the analyses conducted here, download the files of this project into a new created folder named "CAnD3-RR-Assignment." This folder will be your working directory. Once you are able to access and download the dataset, save it to the working directory. Open the program file and read the steps to follow in order. Import the GSS 2017 dataset to Stata. Open and run each do file to clean the data, produce the descriptive summary statistics table, run the regressions and produce regression results tables.
