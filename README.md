Reproducible Research Data Activity

Project Description

This project examines whether there is a statistically significant association between dwelling tenure status and self-rated mental health for older adults aged 65-80 living in urban areas using data from the 2017 Canadian General Social Survey. It also examines whether the association differs in magnitude and significance between males and females. The associations were not statistically significant, in both the model considering the whole sample and the sex-stratified models. Information about what files are included and instructions on how to use them to reproduce results are given below.
